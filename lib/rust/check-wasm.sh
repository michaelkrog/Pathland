# Verify the no_std / wasm32 direction guard: `pathland-core` and `pathland-view`
# must stay `#![no_std]` + `alloc` and compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
#
# This is the guarantee that the protocol core can still target a browser /
# embedded / remote projection later (goal #15, Quarkus SSR + WebSocket). The
# desktop path (`pathland-view-native`) is the only consumer today, but the core
# must not become desktop-only.
#
# Usage: ./check-wasm.sh
#
# Requires the wasm32 target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
